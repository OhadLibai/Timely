Instacart Dataset:

The Core Files: Orders and Products

orders.csv: This file is the backbone of the dataset, chronicling every order placed by each user.
Each row represents a single order and contains the following key information:
order_id: A unique identifier for each order.
user_id: A unique identifier for each customer.
order_number: The sequence number of the order for a particular user (e.g., 1st order, 2nd order).
order_dow: The day of the week the order was placed (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.).
order_hour_of_day: The hour of the day the order was placed.
days_since_prior_order: The number of days since the user's previous order. This is null for a user's first order.

products.csv: This file serves as the master catalog of all unique products available for purchase. It links product IDs to their names and hierarchical categorization:
product_id: A unique identifier for each product.
product_name: The name of the product.
aisle_id: A foreign key that links to the aisles.csv file.
department_id: A foreign key that links to the departments.csv file.
The Transactional Details: Linking Orders and Products

The following two files are pivotal for understanding the composition of each order and are central to next-basket recommendation models:
In short:
    - prior: Represents a user's past orders. This is the largest set and contains the bulk of the historical data for recommender and analysis.
    - train: Contains the most recent order for a subset of users ("future" order based on their "prior" order history).

order_products__prior.csv: This is a massive file that details the contents of all the "prior" orders. Each row represents a single product within a specific order:
order_id: Links to a specific order in the orders.csv file.
product_id: Links to a specific product in the products.csv file.
add_to_cart_order: The sequence in which the product was added to the cart in that particular order.
reordered: A binary flag (1 or 0) indicating whether the user had purchased this specific product before.

order_products__train.csv: Structurally identical to order_products__prior.csv, this file contains the detailed product information for the "train" set of orders.
This is the target data for prediction.

The Product Hierarchy: Aisles and Departments
aisles.csv: This file provides a mapping between aisle_id and the name of the aisle. It allows for a more granular analysis of product categories than departments alone.
aisle_id: A unique identifier for each aisle.
aisle: The name of the aisle (e.g., "fresh fruits," "yogurt").

departments.csv: This file provides the highest level of product categorization.
department_id: A unique identifier for each department.
department: The name of the department (e.g., "produce," "dairy eggs").

In essence, the Instacart dataset is a relational database spread across these CSV files.
By linking them together, we can reconstruct the entire shopping history of each user and leverage this information to build predictive models.
