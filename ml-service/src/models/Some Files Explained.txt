features.csv:
This is the master dataset for training.
Each row in this file represents a single (user, product) pair.
The columns contain all the rich, engineered features that describe the relationship between that user and that product
(e.g., user_total_orders, user_product_order_rate, product_reorder_rate, etc.).
The Stage 1 model learns from these features to predict the probability that a user will reorder a specific product.

instacart_keyset_0.json:
This is a small but crucial file for ensuring your model is trained and evaluated correctly.
It contains lists of user_ids that have been pre-split into three distinct groups: train, valid, and test.
Purpose: Its role is to prevent data leakage. By using these predefined sets, you guarantee that the model is trained
only on the train users, its hyperparameters are tuned on the valid users, and its final,
unbiased performance is measured on the test users, who the model has never seen before.
Essential for building a trustworthy model.
