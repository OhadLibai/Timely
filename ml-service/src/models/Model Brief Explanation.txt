Summary of the New Two-Stage Prediction Model
This new model emulates the sophisticated, stacked pipeline.

Primary Goal
The goal is no longer just to rank products by reorder probability. The new primary goal is to predict a final, chosen basket of products for a user's next order, mirroring a more realistic shopping experience.

Learning Pipeline
The pipeline consists of a two-stage stacked model, managed by a central StackedBasketModel orchestrator:

Stage 1: Candidate Generation (CandidateGenerator):

A powerful LightGBM GBDT model is trained to predict the reorder probability for every potential product for a user.
It then generates three distinct candidate baskets by applying different probability thresholds (e.g., 0.16, 0.20, 0.26) to these predictions.
Crucially, it also creates meta-features that describe these baskets (e.g., the average and max probability of items within each candidate basket).
Stage 2: Basket Selection (BasketSelector):

A Scikit-learn GradientBoostingClassifier acts as a "meta-model".
It does not use the original product features. Instead, its input features are the meta-features generated by Stage 1.
Its goal is to learn from these meta-features to predict which of the three candidate baskets is the optimal choice for that specific order.
Feature Glue
The way data flows between components is now handled entirely in memory by the StackedBasketModel orchestrator, which is a significant improvement over the file-based approach of the reference code.

Training: The orchestrator's train method first trains the Stage 1 model. It then uses this model to generate a new DataFrame of meta-features. This new DataFrame is immediately passed as input to train the Stage 2 model.
Inference: The predict method takes a user_id, generates candidate baskets and meta-features on-the-fly using the loaded Stage 1 model, and then feeds those meta-features to the loaded Stage 2 model to get the final basket selection.
Handling Data Leakage
The training process is designed to be robust against data leakage. The keyset (with its train, valid, test user splits) is used to ensure that the models are trained and validated on distinct sets of users. The final evaluation of the entire pipeline would be performed on the test users, who were not seen during either stage of the training process.

Hyper-params
The new models use powerful hyperparameters adapted from the reference implementation for high performance.

Stage 1 (LightGBM): Uses aggressive settings like num_leaves: 512 for complex trees and min_child_samples: 200 to prevent overfitting on niche data patterns.
Stage 2 (GradientBoostingClassifier): Uses standard, robust parameters like n_estimators: 100 and max_depth: 5.
Inference API
The prediction process is straightforward from the API's perspective. The predict method of the StackedBasketModel takes a user_id and returns a simple Python list of product IDs, representing the final "chosen basket."

Evaluation Strategy
The performance of the entire stacked pipeline is measured by the quality of the final chosen basket. During the training of Stage 2, the F1 score is used to determine which of the three candidate baskets was the "correct" choice, creating the labels for the meta-model. A final end-to-end evaluation would involve running the full prediction pipeline on the test set and using the BasketPredictionEvaluator to score the final baskets against the ground truth.

Deployment Friendliness
This new model is slightly more complex to deploy as it requires managing two model artifacts (stage1_lgbm.pkl and stage2_gbc.pkl) instead of one. However, all of this complexity is hidden behind the StackedBasketModel orchestrator. From the point of view of main.py, the process remains simple: load the orchestrator, and call its predict method.
