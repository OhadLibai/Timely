Hi Claude!
As a starter, you may read the full README.md file that sits in the root directory of the project ('Timely') to get familiar with it and with its components. You should understand the codebase exceptionally good and the connection between its many pieces. Besides, you may scrutinize other files that you assume to be crucial or central for the project.
We want to utilize the project. It incurs many depoloyment bugs. There are some discrepancies in the project that needs to be resolved.
We are at the stage of development and testing. The visuals and the functioning of the app in all of its facets should not be overlooked at all albeit we are not at the production phase (yet). The app should look awesome and the services as well as the communication between them should all be maverick.
We will fix issues one-by-one. All fixations and modifications must be polished and highly qualified.
Do not make superficial job as a result of ending your context window at the expense of solid code.

Here are the first tasks:

1) Confirm that the Dockerfile inside the database adequate the whole project.

2) Confirm that each of the the product and category rendered and live inside the database has an image attached to it. Show me what convinced you. In particular, whether it is realated or not, I saw this:
// Helper for placeholder images if needed directly in controller (though product.imageUrl should be primary)
const getSafePlaceholderImageUrlForDemo = (seedText?: string | null, width = 100, height = 100): string => {
    let seed = 0;
    const textToSeed = seedText || `product_fallback_${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)}`;
    for (let i = 0; i < textToSeed.length; i++) {
        seed = (seed + textToSeed.charCodeAt(i) * (i + 1)) % 1000;
    }
    return `https://picsum.photos/seed/${seed + 3000}/${width}/${height}`; // Different seed base
};

(admin.controller.ts)
-> NO PLACEHOLDER PHOTOS!!!

Moreover, there might be overlapping and/or conflicts regarding the images placements/using. We want to eliminate this, ending in one defenitive approach to store and displaying them.

3) Confirm funcnationality of the button handleEvaluateClick in Metrics.tsx (imports,rendering, backend connectivity, general flow, etc.). In particular it must be manifested inside the JSX.
The display on the screen of the evaluation results, especially in the admin realm, should have a rich looking and eye-catching. Ensure it is being fulfilled. 

4) Ensure that generateNewBasket inside prediction.controller.ts is working as required and delivers what it should deliver. Get into close detail of it. This function's operation is highly critical as part of the overall project flow.

5) Go over main.py insdide ml-service. All of it. Resolve conflicts and/or descrepancies and/or missing parts. Report your findings and changes.

6) shed light upon the using of sqlalchemy and edit README and other files in the codebase accordingly.

7) One critical demand on the app:
I want to demonstrate the model capability and prediction performance.
So for a demo simulation and to show app's interacttion with the user, recommending him his "next basket", I would like pick a random user (say from the Instacart data, since we have history of purchases from there) that apparently has used the app for couple of times (number of purchases that chosen user has in the instacart data, or configuarble weeks or months - that way we can even show that the ML model learns the user better over time) with history of purchases in it, and display (using the many services of the app) his predicted basket. This meant to manifest the app ability to benefit with the user.
This is VERY VERY important thing.
Now I think this might be already implemented in the app. 
What I am asking you is to run an extensive and exhuastive search on the codebase and find out where and if it is already devised.
If not - we will iterate this process and complete this mission.
Hints on where to search: Admin.


8) Please spot EVERY AND ANY note/comment regarding work or job in files that is left to do, implement or elaborate in the future, including placeholders. We will decide upon each case how to handle it.
