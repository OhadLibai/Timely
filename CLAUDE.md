Hi Claude!
At this stage, we want to utilize the project. It incurs many depoloyment bugs. There are some discrepancies in the project that needs to be resolved.
As a starter, you may read the three *.md files that sits in the root directory of the project ('Timely') to get familiar with it and with its components. You should understand the codebase exceptionally good.
Later try to perform basic deployment. See what faults you are encountring and fix them one-by-one.
All fixations and modifications must be polished and highly qualified.
Inform me when and if you are at the brink of your text window exhustion.
