Hi Claude!
At this stage, we want to utilize the project. It incurs many depoloyment bugs. There are some discrepancies in the project that needs to be resolved.
As a starter, you may read the full README.md file that sits in the root directory of the project ('Timely') to get familiar with it and with its components. You should understand the codebase exceptionally good and the connections between its many pieces. Besides, you may scrutinize other files that you assume to be crucial or central for the project.
Try to deploy the project. See what faults you are encountring and fix them one-by-one.
All fixations and modifications must be polished and highly qualified.
If you reach near to your context window please say so and do not make superficial job as a result at the expense of solid code.
