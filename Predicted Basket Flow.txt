The End-to-End Prediction and Rendering Flow:
Frontend Request (PredictedBasket.tsx):
A user action on this page triggers a function call to predictionService.getPredictedBasket().

Frontend Service (prediction.service.ts): 
The getPredictedBasket function makes a GET request to the backend's API endpoint, for example, /api/predictions/my-basket.

Backend Route (prediction.routes.ts): 
The backend router maps the GET /api/predictions/my-basket request to the getMyBasket method in the PredictionController.

Backend Controller (prediction.controller.ts): This is where the core logic happens.

The getMyBasket method first calls the ml-service to get the prediction. 
The ml-service returns a simple list of product IDs (e.g., [101, 203, 405]).
Crucially, the controller then takes this list of IDs and makes a query to its own PostgreSQL database using the Product model. 
The query looks like this: Product.findAll({ where: { id: { [Op.in]: productIds } } }).
This query extracts the full details (name, price, imageUrl, description, etc.) for each predicted product ID from the database.
Backend Response: The controller sends a final JSON response to the frontend containing an array of full product objects, not just IDs.

Frontend Rendering (PredictedBasket.tsx): 
The frontend page receives this array of rich product objects and uses a .map() function to iterate through them,
rendering a ProductCard component for each one, complete with its image, name, and price.
