Image Storage
Images are NOT stored in the application.

The database only stores a URL (a string of text like https://.../image.jpg)
in the imageUrl column of your products and categories tables.

The frontend (ProductCard.tsx or ProductImage.tsx) receives this URL from the backend
and renders a standard HTML <img> tag. The src attribute of the image tag is set to this URL.
The user's web browser then handles fetching the image from that external URL and displaying it on the screen.
