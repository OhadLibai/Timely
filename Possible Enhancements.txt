1. A more advanced dashboard might include:

Time-based filters (e.g., "Revenue this month").
Calculated metrics (e.g., "Average Order Value").
Charts showing trends over time.

Consider broadening that.


2. Architectual decision regarding fetching user past purchases and other attributes
from the database in order to predict the next basket:

Currently, the Backend proactively fetches the data and sends it to the ML service.
Instead of the backend fetching data for the ML service we can shift it such that the ML service
fetch the data he needs for his calculations (e.g purchases's histories and other attributes) by himself from the database.
That is connecting the ml-service with the database.

I can think of three changes:
1. Activate the Direct Database Connection in the ML Service
2. Modify the ML Service Endpoint to Fetch Data
3. Simplify the Backend Controller

Can you think of more changes needs to be deployed?
